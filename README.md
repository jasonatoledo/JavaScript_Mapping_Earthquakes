# JavaScript_Mapping_Earthquakes Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to take the existing earthquake map data from the module and add on to it. The first addon was a tectonic layer to showcase where the tectonic plates are located and adjust the color so that it is legible on all map formats. The second addon was creating a major earthquake layer that a user could toggle to see earthquakes with a magnitude of 4 or higher easiy. The final addon was adding a 3rd map style from the mapbox library for a user to have as another option on the layers control.

Overall, this was a fun and visually pleasing module.
